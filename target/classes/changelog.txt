0.17 Added Win Condition (J)

    I again really insist on making the creation of the board iterational instead with manually typed-in manually numbers
    As one of most important things right now

0.17a Win Condition Fix (J)


0.2 (J)
    The Code is utter complete garbage at this moment
        - Main should stick to be just window manager and give-get guy for other classes
        - Things should be done iteratively
        - Board should be board creator
        - PlayGameController should handle mouse & turns

    Made overhaul of OptionsController (J)
        * Now the code is simple to understand and as easy & short as possible
        * Made new class to retrieve and send those options
        * Fixed OptionsController Warnings (J)
    Made some steps to retrieve settings from options (J)

0.21 (J)
    Changing few values to be player dependent
    Not arbitrally chosen
    Trying to make alghoritm for board and players.....

0.22a (J & G)
    Board is in Board

0.22b (J)
    Creating preferences but it probably isn't what we need

0.3 (G) Major update
    Added Client.Java class that is working with server. ATM the game is not working only if You run server first
    (singleplayer is now server, but only becouse I needed somewhere to test it
CHINESE CHECKERS TRANSFER PROTOCOL:
NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS int n -information from server
QUIT - information from server
MOVE int targetX targetY fromX fromY - infrmation from and to server
COLOR value Color - information about what color is Yours for ex. "COLOR 0x000000FF "
END_TURN - information to server that you ended Your turn
YOUR_TURN - information to client that it is his turn
START - start of the game
