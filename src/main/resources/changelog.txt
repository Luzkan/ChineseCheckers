    I again really insist on making the creation of the board iterational instead with manually typed-in manually numbers
    As one of most important things right now

0.17a Win Condition Fix (J)


0.2 (J)
    The Code is utter complete garbage at this moment
        - Main should stick to be just window manager and give-get guy for other classes
        - Things should be done iteratively
        - Board should be board creator
        - PlayGameController should handle mouse & turns

    Made overhaul of OptionsController (J)
        * Now the code is simple to understand and as easy & short as possible
        * Made new class to retrieve and send those options
        * Fixed OptionsController Warnings (J)
    Made some steps to retrieve settings from options (J)

0.21 (J)
    Changing few values to be player dependent
    Not arbitrally chosen
    Trying to make alghoritm for board and players.....

0.22a (J & G)
    Board is in Board

0.22b (J)
    Creating preferences but it probably isn't what we need

0.3 (G) Major update
    Added Client.Java class that is working with server. ATM the game is not working only if You run server first
    (singleplayer is now server, but only becouse I needed somewhere to test it
CHINESE CHECKERS TRANSFER PROTOCOL:
NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS int n -information from server
QUIT - information from server
MOVE int targetX targetY fromX fromY - infrmation from and to server
COLOR value Color - information about what color is Yours for ex. "COLOR 0x000000FF "
END_TURN - information to server that you ended Your turn
YOUR_TURN - information to client that it is his turn
START - start of the game

0.3a (J)
    If it's major update then I switch your update number from 0.23 to BIG 0.3 PUSH

0.31 (J)
    Added PlayGame functionality to Join just like it was previously done to Singleplayer as requested

0.4 (J)
    - Reworked Options Layout
    - Created Connection Layout
    - Added all the system to make it work
    - Options works now
        * They are saved to file now
        * File is formatted as XML
        * File is automatically generated if it doesn't exist
        * File is placed in ChineseCheckers folder
    - Added buttons to move around everywhere
    - Folder restructure

0.41 (J)
    - Win condition fix
    - Options fully functional with getters and setters from file

0.42 (J)
    - Moved your client code from Singleplayer to Joingame so Singleplayer works again and
      Joingame is now linked to that (as it should be)
    - Singleplayer game creation is now option dependent
    - Board setuper is now a static void function (<--- NOTICE THIS CHANGE, THATS HUGE)
    - All warnings fixed in code that I wrote which is in class that is good-to-go w/o any further change (probably)

0.5 (G)
    Quite a big update. The server now sends moves back and forth. Only 1st player connected gets to make any moves but thats only becose END_TURN button doesn't do anything.
    It should send info to the server that turn has ended. When this command will be send next all the players get info that it it next player's turn.
    Win condition is not yet implemented. Client should be also able to only move his pieces but I dodnt have time ( it's an easy fix, few minutes of work)
    Added Board.ServerForceMove - it is used for when server sends us a move to make, we dont have to check it for the 3rd time xd

0.51 (J)
    - Fixed the options problem
    - Fixed nodes for options, now its working
    - Options are now officially working with the save-to-file and read-from-file feature

0.52 (J)
    - Added warning alert about illegal option set (wrong amount of players).
    - Deleted developer options to move around quickly.
    - Thankfully everything adjusted as I intended at the beginning so no further change in size was needed

0.53 G
    -added turn logic while multiplayer
    -added a few things both to serwer and client.
    - Found a bug when some legall jumps are illegal on the server but legal in client and i have no idea why.


0.54 (J)
    - Bug appears because the first check on shifted map will be performed on null object since the change to null circles that wont be used (instead of having bgcolor)
    - Fixed

0.6 (J)
    - Move and Jump limit
    - Harder than you think though
    - Found and Fixed that marble can jump into a marble
    - End Turn shows correct player
    - Win Condition check (works)
    * there is no reset for move/jump right now

0.6a (J)
    - And now there is that reset (after end turn btn).
    * important comment read in @PlayGameController in @void endTurn

0.6b (J)
    - To end turn player must perform any movement.

0.6c (J)
    - Instead of Player #, Player Color
